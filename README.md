### Abstract

With the introduction of various messenger services one important issue that we personally face every day is spamming. Spamming not only increases the number of messages in a group but it also camouflages important information. Many times an important deadline or meeting info is overlooked because of spam messages just pouring in your chats. Not only that with the rise in whatsapp groups, it becomes tough to manage and go through each message and frankly who has the time to do that. Well our team absolute zero has come up with a solution- an application based on a ML model. Our app reads user messages, provides the user with a summary of a conversation, lists the important points, displays the topics discussed in a conversation and shows links shared during the conversation. 

Hold on that was just one feature, our app also allows you to pin important messages, summarizes and displays them separately. Well that is not it, we also give our user an option to choose elite members and highlight their messages and spammers and ignore their messages.  

Last but not the least one common issue we all face while using whatsapp is again and again we have to save an unknown number and then drop a text but our app provides you with an ability to directly message the number on whatsapp.
Well we are not going to stop here. Our application is not limited to whatsapp messenger in future but we also plan to include other messaging services like telegram, linkedin, messenger, etc. We also aim to use google calendars to automatically schedule your meetings.

We can generate income from ad revenue and plan on introducing paid features like using dyte video conferencing plugin to contact an unknown number. 

What are the additional uses for which this app can be used?
This app reduces the burden on students and helps them focus on just important points rather than going through all the spam messages.
This app can also be used to stop cyber bully by providing the user with an alert whenever the app comes across a text which could pose a threat.

We plan on incorporating as many features as discussed above and present a working prototype.
